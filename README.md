# Interview-Prep

**Cloud & DevOps**

a. Cloud is computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software ...etc over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. DevOps brings development and operations together. It is a software engineering practice that involves collaboration within teams during development of operations to enable instantaneous deployment of products and services by utilizing a continuous integration and continuous delivery approach along with an agile and flexible development method.  

b. I have used cloud services when deploying applications and node-api connected with databases from my local environment to an EC2 instance on AWS. I have been learning and using DevOps during the last 6 weeks of the training program within our project utilizing the tools such as trello, packer, terraform, jenkins, and testing during the development cycle of operations for our project.  

c. Using cloud services allows users to be able to obtain computing services on a pay-as-you-go basis, which cuts costs of actually having to purchace and own servers or storage. Being able to only pay and use what you need depending on your current usage state. DevOps allows integration of development and operations teams for consistancy and realiability during the development cyle utilizing the tools and practices to respond to frequent changes.

**CICD**

a. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This practice allows for automation in building, testing, and deployment of applications. 

b. Created a Jenkins Pipeline to integrate node-api project with testing and connected with webhooks through github repository to be able to trigger testing on my codebase when a push to main branch is done.  

c. Errors and security issues can be identified and fixed earlier throughout the development cycle and much more easily. Improves productivity and efficiency by streamlining workflow through built-in automation, testing, and collaborattion. 

**Jenkins**

a. Open Source automation server. It helps automate parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying. 

b. Used Jenkins Pipeline to automate testing and the build of applications using connection through github repositories and webhooks to trigger during events specified during configuration of Jenkins. 

c. Allows for constant monitoring and instantaneous notifications of errors in development cycle. 

**Provisioning**

a. Process of setting up and configuring infrastructure and integration. 

b. Used provisioning scripts when setting up VagrantFile for vagrant environment to automate commands for integration and connection of application to virtual machine.
Used Terraform (IaC) to provision Infrastructure and configuration of an AWS instance using AMI id's created by packer. 

c. Manage and automate the infrastructure components allow efficiency and reduction of human error during development and deployment of applications.
